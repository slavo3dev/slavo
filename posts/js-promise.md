JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities have evolved considerably over the years. From callbacks to Promises and now, with ES7, the Async/Await paradigm. In modern web development, mastering these asynchronous techniques is not just advantageous; it's essential.

## Why is Asynchronous JavaScript Important?

In the modern web development landscape, understanding asynchronous operations is indispensable. Asynchronous JavaScript fundamentally reshapes how applications perform tasks, ensuring they are responsive, efficient, and provide a seamless user experience. Let's delve deeper into why asynchronous programming in JavaScript is so pivotal.

### 1. **Non-Blocking Nature of JavaScript**

JavaScript, particularly in the browser, runs on a single thread. This means that traditionally, code executes line by line, top to bottom. If any operation is slow (like a network request or a hefty computation), it would "block" the rest of the processes, freezing the interface and making for a poor user experience.

Asynchronous JavaScript, through constructs like callbacks, promises, and async/await, allows these potentially blocking operations to be initiated without waiting for completion. The rest of the program can run, and once the asynchronous operation finishes, its results can be processed.

### 2. **Handling I/O Bound Operations**

Many operations in web applications are I/O bound. This includes tasks like:

- Fetching data from an API.
- Loading images or other assets.
- Reading from or writing to local storage.
- Database operations in Node.js applications.

These operations can be time-consuming. Asynchronous JavaScript initiates these tasks and then "moves on" until the job is completed. At this point, a callback can handle the result. This ensures the main thread remains unblocked, leading to more responsive applications.

### 3. **Better User Experience (UX)**

Imagine if the entire site froze every time you clicked a button on a website that fetched data. With asynchronous operations, users can continue interacting with parts of the application while other factors might be bringing data, updating, or performing computations. This leads to a smoother, more interactive user experience.

### 4. **Concurrent Operations**

Asynchronous JavaScript allows for the initiation of multiple operations at once. Using constructs like `Promise.all()`, for example, you can start several network requests simultaneously and wait for them to complete. This concurrency can lead to faster overall operation times, as tasks are performed in parallel rather than sequentially.

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**

Asynchronous patterns, especially promise and async/await, provide structured ways to handle errors. Instead of managing errors in multiple places (as with nested callbacks), you can centralize error handling, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

### 6. **Scalability in Backend Development**

In server-side development using Node.js, asynchronous programming ensures that the server can handle multiple requests without waiting for individual tasks to complete. This makes Node.js exceptionally scalable for I/O-heavy tasks.

### 7. **Evolution of Web Standards and APIs**

Modern browser APIs and web standards often use asynchronous patterns. For example, the Fetch API for network requests returns promises. Understanding asynchronous JavaScript is essential to work with these modern tools and libraries effectively.

In an environment where efficiency, responsiveness, and user experience are paramount, asynchronous programming stands out as one of the pillars of modern web development. As web applications grow in complexity, the importance of understanding and effectively leveraging asynchronous JavaScript only becomes more pronounced.

## Promises: The Core of Asynchronous Programming

Despite its single-threaded nature, JavaScript needs a way to manage asynchronous operationsâ€”tasks that might take an unpredictable amount of time to complete. That's where Promises step in. Promises are a significant evolution in handling asynchronous processes, bringing clarity and utility to JavaScript's landscape.

## What Are Promises?

At their core, Promises are JavaScript objects representing an asynchronous operation's eventual completion (or failure) and its resulting value. They serve as a bridge between the producing code (which performs the asynchronous action) and the consuming code (which defines what should happen after the action is completed).

### Why do Promises Matter?

- **Composability**: You can chain Promises, allowing for a sequence of asynchronous operations. Each `then` waits for the previous one to finish.
- **Error Handling**: By centralizing error-handling in `catch` blocks, Promises prevent the infamous "callback hell" scenario, simplifying the management of asynchronous errors.
- **Improved Readability**: Promise-based code tends to be more self-documenting, with more precise intent and fewer nested callbacks.

### The Anatomy of a Promise

1. **States**: Every Promise goes through one of three potential states:

   - **`pending`**: The initial state; the promise's outcome is undecided.
   - **`fulfilled`**: The asynchronous operation completed successfully.
   - **`rejected`**: An error occurred during the asynchronous operation.

2. **Executor Function**: When creating a Promise, you provide a function (the executor) that gets two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`.

   - `resolve`: Call this when the asynchronous operation completes successfully.
   - `reject`: Call this if there's an error.

   ```javascript
   const promiseExample = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       // Simulate a coin toss
       const coinToss = Math.random() > 0.5;
       if (coinToss) {
         resolve("Heads!"); // We call resolve if it's heads.
       } else {
         reject("Tails!"); // We call reject if it's tails.
       }
     }, 1000);
   });
   ```

3. **Consuming a Promise**: Once a Promise is created, you can specify reactions to fulfill or reject.

   - **`then()`**: Adds handlers for fulfillment. It can be chained for multiple steps.
   - **`catch()`**: Catches any errors or rejections in the Promise.
   - **`finally()`**: A block that will run regardless of the Promise's fate.

   ```javascript
   promiseExample
     .then((result) => console.log(result)) // Handles fulfillment.
     .catch((error) => console.error(error)) // Handles rejection.
     .finally(() => console.log("Coin toss done!")); // Executes after either resolution or rejection.
   ```

### Static Promise Methods

1. **`Promise.all(iterable)`**: Waits for all promises in the iterable to be fulfilled. If one of them gets rejected, the Promise returned by `Promise.all` immediately rejects with that error.
2. **`Promise.race(iterable)`**: Waits until any promises are settled (fulfilled or rejected), then proceeds with that Promise's result/error.
3. **`Promise.resolve(value)`**: Returns a Promise object resolved with the given value.
4. **`Promise.reject(reason)`**: Returns a Promise object left with the given sense.

## Core Concepts of Promises in JavaScript

Promises in JavaScript revolve around several foundational concepts that make them robust and flexible tools for asynchronous programming. Understanding these core concepts is essential for mastering promises and the broader landscape of asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### **1. States of a Promise**

Every Promise exists in one of three possible states:

- **`pending`**: The initial state when a promise is created. The Promise's result has yet to be discovered.
- **`fulfilled`**: The state indicating that the Promise has been completed successfully and has a resulting value.
- **`rejected`**: The state when the Promise has completed with an error, and there's a reason for the failure.

Significantly, once a promise has been fulfilled or rejected, its state cannot change again, ensuring predictable behavior.

### **2. Immutability**

After a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its value (or rejection reason) becomes immutable. This ensures that the Promise's value can't be altered, which brings consistency and avoids potential bugs caused by value changes.

### **3. Chaining**

One of the powerful features of promises is their ability to be chained together:

- The `.then()` method can be linked in sequence, and each receives the value from the previous Promise.
- Each `.then()` or `.catch()` in the chain returns a new promise, making it possible to link multiple asynchronous operations together.
- If a `then` or `catch` handler returns a value, it will be wrapped in a resolved promise. If it throws an exception, it will produce a rejected promise.

### **4. Error Propagation**

If a promise is rejected and there's no `.catch()` handler in the chain, the error will propagate until it finds one. If no handler is found, it becomes an unhandled promise rejection. This centralized error-handling mechanism simplifies debugging and management of potential issues.

### **5. Consumption Patterns**

Promises offer a few methods to interact based on their results:

- **`then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`**: Accepts two callback functions. The first is called when the Promise is fulfilled, and the second is when it's rejected.
- **`catch(onRejected)`**: Provides a way to handle errors in the promise chain.
- **`finally(onFinally)`**: Allows you to run some code regardless of the Promise's state (fulfilled or rejected).

### **6. Composition**

Promises can be combined or composed in various ways to manage multiple asynchronous operations:

- **`Promise.all(iterable)`**: Waits for all promises in the iterable to be fulfilled. Returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of the values of the passed promises.

  ```javascript
  Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((results) => {
    // Both promise1 and promise2 are resolved here
  });
  ```

- **`Promise.race(iterable)`**: Waits for the first Promise to be fulfilled or rejected and mirrors its state.
- **`Promise.allSettled(iterable)`**: Waits for all promises to settle (fulfilled or rejected) and returns their results.

### **7. Transforming Values**

With promises, transforming values between asynchronous steps is straightforward. A value returned from a `.then()` callback function becomes the resolution value of the following Promise in the chain.

Promises introduce structure, clarity, and predictability to the sometimes chaotic world of asynchronous JavaScript by encapsulating asynchronous operations within these core concepts. As you familiarize yourself with these foundational ideas, you'll find that promises simplify the process of writing asynchronous code and make it more robust and maintainable.

## Async/Await: A Syntactic Panacea

Promises undeniably ushered in a new era of clarity and manageability in asynchronous JavaScript. But as developers stitched together increasingly complex chains of `.then()` and `.catch()`, another abstraction layer became necessary to simplify asynchronous code further. Enter `async/await`, a syntactic sugar atop promises that read more like traditional synchronous code. Here's a detailed look into this powerful feature.

\*\* Book Recommendation: [Eloquent JavaScript](https://amzn.to/44UeeZ6)

### **1. Introduction**

The `async` and `await` keywords are syntactic constructs introduced in ES2017 (ES8) to make working with promises more concise and readable. At its heart, this feature does not introduce new functionality; instead, it's a new way to work with promises.

### **2. Declaring an Async Function**

Functions declared with the `async` keyword always return a promise:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  return "Data fetched!";
}

fetchData().then((data) => console.log(data)); // Logs: "Data fetched!"
```

Even if you return a non-promise value from an async function, it's automatically wrapped in a resolved promise.

### **3. The Await Keyword**

Inside an `async` function, the `await` keyword can be used to pause the function's execution until the promise is settled:

```javascript
async function fetchDataAndProcess() {
  const data = await fetchDataFromServer(); // Assuming this function returns a promise
  console.log(data);
  return processData(data); // Assuming processData returns a value or a promise
}
```

Using `await`, the function execution halts at that line until `fetchDataFromServer`'s promise is resolved. The value of the resolved promise is then assigned to the `data` variable.

### **4. Error Handling**

With `async/await`, you can employ the traditional `try/catch` blocks for error handling, making it much more intuitive:

```javascript
async function fetchAndHandleData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchDataFromServer();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
}
```

### **5. Combining Async/Await with Promises**

While `async/await` offers a cleaner syntax, you can freely combine it with traditional promise methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetchFromServer();
  return data;
}

fetchData().then(processData).catch(handleError).finally(cleanUp);
```

### **6. Parallel Execution**

While the `await` keyword can sequentially wait for promises, you can execute multiple promises in parallel using `Promise.all`:

```javascript
async function fetchMultipleData() {
  const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([
    fetchData1(),
    fetchData2(),
  ]);
  // Both data1 and data2 are available here
}
```

### **7. Cleaner Code**

One of the most significant advantages of `async/await` is decluttering callback chains. Nested promises, or "callback hell," become linear and readable, enhancing code maintainability.

### **8. Cautionary Notes**

- Overuse of `await` can inadvertently lead to serial execution. When operations don't depend on each other, consider executing them concurrently.
- Always handle potential promise rejections using `try/catch` in `async/await` to avoid unhandled promise rejections.

`Async/await` acts as a soothing balm over the sometimes prickly syntax of promises. By allowing developers to write asynchronous code that mirrors the simplicity and readability of synchronous code, it truly is a syntactic panacea for the evolving landscape of JavaScript.

Promises have revolutionized asynchronous programming in JavaScript, offering a standardized approach to handle asynchronous tasks. They encapsulate the complex timing logic and state management, making it easier for developers to focus on the main reason without getting lost in callback mazes. As you dive deeper into JavaScript, understanding and mastering Promises becomes indispensable for efficient and effective coding.

## Best Practices Using Promises

Working with promises effectively means understanding their syntax and capabilities and adhering to best practices that have emerged over time. The following are some widely accepted best practices for using promises in JavaScript:

### **1. Always Handle Rejections**

- Unhandled promise rejections can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs. Always include a `.catch()` at the end of your promise chains or use `try/catch` with `async/await` to handle errors.
- Listen for the `unhandledrejection` event on the `window` object to catch any unhandled rejections globally:

  ```javascript
  window.addEventListener("unhandledrejection", (event) => {
    console.error("Unhandled promise rejection:", event.reason);
  });
  ```

### **2. Avoid Nested Promise Chains**

- If you find yourself nesting `.then()` callbacks, consider flattening them to make your code more readable:

  ```javascript
  // Avoid this:
  fetchData().then((data) => {
    process(data).then((result) => {
      console.log(result);
    });
  });

  // Prefer this:
  fetchData()
    .then((data) => process(data))
    .then((result) => console.log(result));
  ```

### **3. Donâ€™t Mix Callbacks and Promises**

- Stick to one pattern within a single function or logic block. Mixing callbacks and promises can make code more precise and easier to maintain.

### **4. Use `Promise.all()` Wisely**

- When multiple independent promises can run concurrently, use `Promise.all()`. But be aware: `Promise.all()` will be rejected when one of its promises is left, which might not always be the desired behavior.

- If you want to wait for all promises regardless of their resolution or rejection, consider using `Promise.allSettled()`.

### **5. Avoid the "Explicit Promise Construction Antipattern"**

- Donâ€™t create a new promise when you already have one. Often, developers unnecessarily wrap existing promises inside new promise objects.

  ```javascript
  // Avoid this:
  function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      someAPI.fetch().then(resolve).catch(reject);
    });
  }

  // Prefer this:
  function fetchData() {
    return someAPI.fetch();
  }
  ```

### **6. Use `async/await` for Better Readability**

- For complex operations or sequences of asynchronous tasks, using `async/await` can often result in more precise and readable code than chaining multiple `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

### **7. Chain Return Values**

- Remember that `.then()` callbacks should return values (or promises), which will be passed to the next `.then()`. This allows you to chain promises and their results effectively.

### **8. Be Mindful of Microtasks**

- Promises use the microtask queue, meaning theyâ€™ll consistently execute before timers or other macro tasks. Be aware of this when considering the order of asynchronous operations.

### **9. Limit the Scope of `try/catch` with `async/await`**

- When using `async/await`, it's common to wrap everything inside a `try/catch`. However, limit the scope of `try/catch` to the exact asynchronous operation you're trying to handle for more clarity and specificity.

### **10. Be Clear with Your API Return Types**

- If you're writing a function that returns a promise, ensure it consistently returns it. Avoid situations where a function might sometimes return a promise and other times return a plain value.

In essence, while promises offer a powerful way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, using them thoughtfully and consistently is crucial. Adhering to these best practices can result in more maintainable, readable, and robust asynchronous code.

## Advanced Aspects of Promises

Promises in JavaScript are fundamental to handling asynchronous operations. Once familiar with the basics, delving into the advanced facets of promises can help build more robust and efficient applications. Here's a deep dive into some advanced aspects:

### **_1. Promise Chaining_**

While this is often touched upon in introductory discussions, the power and complexity of chaining can be immense. Beyond simple `.then()` chaining, you can return a new promise inside a `.then()` to create complex chains of asynchronous operations:

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    return processData(data); // returns a new promise
  })
  .then((processedData) => {
    return saveToDatabase(processedData); // returns another promise
  })
  .then((saveStatus) => {
    console.log(saveStatus);
  });
```

### **2. Promise Combinators**

Promise combinators are methods that operate on multiple promises, whether aggregating their results, waiting for all or some of them, or racing them against each other. These combinators are essential when dealing with multiple concurrent operations, helping developers manage collective promise states more efficiently.

### **1. `Promise.all()`**

- **Description**: Given an iterable (like an array) of promises, `Promise.all()` returns a new promise that is fulfilled with an array of fulfillment values of the passed promises, in the same order. However, if any of the passed promises are rejected, the `Promise.all()` method will be rejected with the reason for the first promise that got rejected.

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const promise1 = Promise.resolve(1);
  const promise2 = Promise.resolve(2);
  const promise3 = Promise.resolve(3);

  Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
    .then((values) => console.log(values)) // [1, 2, 3]
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

### **2. `Promise.allSettled()`**

- **Description**: This method returns a promise with an array of each input promise's settled states (either fulfilled or rejected). This is particularly useful when you need to ensure all processes have been completed, but you don't necessarily need them all to succeed.

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const promise1 = Promise.resolve(1);
  const promise2 = Promise.reject("Error!");
  const promise3 = Promise.resolve(3);

  Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((results) =>
    console.log(results),
  );
  /* 
      [
          { status: "fulfilled", value: 1 },
          { status: "rejected", reason: "Error!" },
          { status: "fulfilled", value: 3 }
      ]
      */
  ```

### **3. `Promise.race()`**

- **Description**: `Promise.race()` returns a promise that settles (either fulfills or rejects) as soon as one of the promises in the iterable settles, with the result or reason from that promise.

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one"),
  );
  const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two"),
  );

  Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
    .then((value) => console.log(value)) // "two" because promise2 resolves first
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

### **4. `Promise.any()`**

- **Description**: Introduced in ECMAScript 2021, `Promise.any()` takes an iterable of Promise objects. As soon as one of the promises in the iterable is fulfilled, it returns a single promise that resolves with the value of that promise. If no promises in the iterable are fulfilled (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an `AggregateError`.

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const promise1 = Promise.reject(0);
  const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, "quick"),
  );
  const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, "slow"),
  );

  Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
    .then((value) => console.log(value)) // "quick"
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

These combinators offer more elegant solutions for complex asynchronous tasks that depend on multiple promises. Knowing when and how to use them is crucial for effective asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

### **3. Error Propagation**

Errors in promises propagate down the chain until they're caught. If an error is not caught by a `.catch()`, it will propagate through subsequent `.then()` methods:

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    throw new Error("Failed processing"); // this error will propagate
  })
  .then((processedData) => {
    //This will be skipped
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.message); // "Failed processing"
  });
```

### **4. Multiple `.catch()` Handlers**

You can have multiple `.catch()` handlers, and they can be used to handle specific errors in different ways:

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    throw new Error("Network issue");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.message === "Network issue") {
      // handle network issues
      return fallbackData();
    }
    throw error; // rethrow the error for the next handler
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle other errors
  });
```

### **5. Promise Interoperability**

Promises in JavaScript are designed to be interoperable. A then able (an object with a `then` method) can be treated as a promise. This makes integration with libraries and other systems that use their promise-like implementations seamless.

### **6. Microtasks and the Event Loop**

Promises don't technically execute in parallel (because JavaScript is single-threaded). Still, they use the microtask queue, a type of task queue in the event loop with higher priority than other tasks. Promise callbacks will execute before other tasks like `setTimeout` or UI rendering.

### **7. `finally()` Method**

Promises have a `.finally()` method that will always execute, regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected. It's a great place to perform cleanup actions, such as hiding a loading spinner:

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    hideLoadingSpinner();
  });
```

By understanding and incorporating these advanced aspects of promises, developers can more effectively harness the power of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Remember, it's crucial to maintain clarity in your promise chains and handle errors gracefully to ensure a robust application.

## Practice Section: Promises

Test your understanding of Promises with these practice questions and coding challenges! From basic to mid-level, these exercises will help you cement your grasp of asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### **Questions**

1. What are the three possible states of a promise?
2. How do you create a new promise using the `Promise` constructor?
3. What is the purpose of the `resolve` and `reject` parameters in the executor function of a promise?
4. Which static method can you use on the `Promise` object to wait for multiple promises to resolve before proceeding?
5. What happens if you reject a promise but do not have a `.catch()` method in your promise chain?

### **Code Challenges**

**1. Basic Promise Creation**:

Write a function called `delay` that returns a promise. This promise should resolve after a given number of milliseconds.

```javascript
function delay(ms) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
delay(1000).then(() => console.log("Delayed by 1 second!"));
```

**2. Promise Chaining**:

Given an array of URLs, write a function called `fetchFirstValidURL` that fetches these URLs one by one until a successful response is received. If the fetch is successful, resolve the promise with the URL's content. If no URLs return a successful response, reject the promise with an error.

Note: Use the `fetch` function available in browsers for fetching.

```javascript
function fetchFirstValidURL(urls) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
const urls = ["invalidURL1.com", "invalidURL2.com", "validURL.com"];
fetchFirstValidURL(urls)
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

**3. Promise.all Practice**:

Given an array of integers, write a function called `squareRoots` that returns a promise. This promise should resolve with an array of square roots of these integers. However, if any of the integers are negative, the promise should be rejected with an error message.

```javascript
function squareRoots(numbers) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
squareRoots([4, 9, 16, 25])
  .then((roots) => console.log(roots)) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

**4. Async/Await Conversion**:

Convert the following promise-based function into an async/await function:

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      if (data.success) {
        return data.payload;
      } else {
        throw new Error(data.message);
      }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
}

// Convert the above function to use async/await
```

## Advanced Practice Section: Promises

Dive deeper into Promises and asynchronous JavaScript with these advanced questions and coding challenges. Perfect for those who are looking to stretch their understanding!

### **_Questions_**

1. How does the `async/await` syntax handle errors, both syntactically and under the hood?
2. Explain how `Promise.race()` works. Can it be used to implement timeouts for promises? How?
3. What's the difference between `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()`?
4. How do microtasks in JavaScript's event loop relate to promises?
5. What is the potential downside of returning values without explicitly wrapping them in a promise within an async function?

### **_Code Challenges_**

**1. Implement a Promise Timeout**:

Write a function `promiseWithTimeout` that wraps a promise with a timeout, so if the promise doesn't resolve or is rejected within the given timeout, it's automatically dismissed.

```javascript
function promiseWithTimeout(promise, ms) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
const slowPromise = new Promise((resolve) =>
  setTimeout(resolve, 5000, "Done"),
);
promiseWithTimeout(slowPromise, 3000)
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error.message));
```

**2. Sequential Execution**:

Given an array of functions that return promises, write a function `executeInSequence` that runs these functions in sequence (i.e., waits for one to complete before moving on to the next).

```javascript
function executeInSequence(funcs) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
const funcs = [
  () => delay(1000).then(() => console.log("First")),
  () => delay(500).then(() => console.log("Second")),
  () => delay(2000).then(() => console.log("Third")),
];
executeInSequence(funcs);
```

**3. Batched Promise Execution**:

Write a function `executeInBatches` that takes in an array of functions (that return promises) and an integer `n`. The process should execute the promises in batches of `n`, waiting for all promises to be complete before moving on to the following collection.

```javascript
function executeInBatches(funcs, n) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
const funcs = [
  () => delay(1000).then(() => console.log("First")),
  () => delay(500).then(() => console.log("Second")),
  () => delay(2000).then(() => console.log("Third")),
  // ... more functions
];
executeInBatches(funcs, 2);
```

**4. Advanced Error Handling with Async/Await**:

Given a function that fetches data from an API, handle all potential errors: network issues, invalid JSON responses, and status codes that indicate failure.

```javascript
async function robustFetchData(url) {
  // Your code here
}

// Usage
robustFetchData("https://api.sample.com/data")
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error.message));
```

These advanced challenges touch upon practical scenarios where understanding the intricacies of promises and asynchronous JavaScript is crucial. After completing the challenges, compare solutions with peers or trusted sources to gain new insights and optimizations.
