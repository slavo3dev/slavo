### When we are writing TypeScript code, we are just writing JavaScript

TypeScript is very powerful compiler that you can run over your code to compile your typescript code to JavaScript.

```js
    // TypeScript = JavaScript + A Type System
    const name: string = "Slavo_3";
    const isBlog: boolean = true;
```
