Intersection and Union types are one of the ways in which you can compose types.
It's allow us to combine other types.

Suppose that you have two types: UserName and MemberName

```js
   type userName = {
        name: string;
        privileges= string[];
   }

    type MemberName = {
        name: string;
        paidSubscription: Date;
    }

    // The following defines two intersection types:
    type User = guestUser & memberName

    const userOne: User  = {
        name: "Slavo_3",
        privileges: ["admin"].
        paidSubscription: new Date() | string 

    }
```

When you intersect types, the order of the types doesnâ€™t matter.

As we are doing in the example above, intersection types can be helpful when used with object types.
You can use them with any types.

```js

  type Numeric = string | number;
  type Combinable = number | boolean 

  type Universal = Combinable & Numeric; // type number

```

- TypeScript sees that universal as type number because that is the only intersection we have in the example.
- Intersection operator can be used with any type and then builds the intersection of these types
