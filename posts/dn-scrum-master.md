### Difference Between QA Manual Tester and QA Engineer: A Detailed Comparison

Understanding the distinctions between a QA Manual Tester and a QA Engineer is crucial for those considering a career in Quality Assurance. Both roles are essential in ensuring the quality and functionality of software products, but they involve different responsibilities, skill sets, and tools. This section provides a detailed comparison between QA Manual Testers and QA Engineers.

#### Role and Responsibilities

##### QA Manual Tester

- **Primary Focus**: QA Manual Testers primarily manually test software applications to identify defects and ensure that the software meets specified requirements.
- **Test Execution**: They execute test cases without the assistance of automated tools. This involves following predefined steps to verify that the software behaves as expected.
- **Defect Reporting**: QA Manual Testers document and report any defects they find during the testing process. They use bug-tracking tools to log issues and track their status until resolution.
- **Test Case Design**: They create detailed test cases and test plans based on the requirements and design specifications of the software.
- **Exploratory Testing**: QA Manual Testers often perform exploratory testing to uncover defects that predefined test cases may not cover. This involves using the application in an unstructured way to identify issues.

##### QA Engineer

- **Primary Focus**: QA Engineers focus on manual and automated testing. They are responsible for developing and maintaining automated test scripts and frameworks to improve testing efficiency and coverage.
- **Test Automation**: QA Engineers design, develop, and execute automated tests using various automation tools and frameworks. This helps in reducing repetitive manual testing tasks and increases test coverage.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: They integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines to ensure that tests are run continuously, providing rapid feedback on the quality of the software.
- **Performance and Security Testing**: QA Engineers may also be involved in performance testing (using tools like JMeter) and security testing (using tools like OWASP ZAP) to ensure the software meets performance and security standards.
- **Technical Skills**: They possess strong programming skills and are proficient in scripting languages (such as Python, Java, or JavaScript) and automation tools (such as Selenium, TestNG, or JUnit).

#### Skill Set

##### QA Manual Tester
