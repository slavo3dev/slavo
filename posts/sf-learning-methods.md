### Questions that are hard to answer

- What is the best learning method?
- How to learn and understand fast?

The most valuable skill that you can develop is to learn fast. If you know how to learn fast, you will move, adapt and change things quickly.

Learning is challenging, and it's individual from person to person. Every person has their system.

I developed a system that works super efficiently. With this strategy, I changed careers from System Admin to HR Department to FrontEnd Developer, grew to FullStack Cross Platform Developer, and now I am a Senior Software Engineer.

When I started learning FrontEnd Development, I struggled a lot. I couldn't understand some topics and could do a little every time on my own. I became addicted to tutorials/code_along - "Tutorial Hall" or copying past code examples from StackOverflow, and I knew everything and nothing.

Then after a year of hitting my head into the wall, I decided to change my learning approach. I decided to start again, but this time I dedicated six months. Before learning, I committed sixty days to read and learning about learning.

### Read a lot of books, and some of them I will share

- Deep Work
- The Road to Excellence
- Pragmatic Programmer
- Ultralearning
- Atomic Habits

After reading and learning how to learn, I decided to do six cycles of MLPS ( microlearning -> Practice <- Spaced Repetition )

That system helped me become FrontEnd Dev in four months, and in just a year, I could build FullStack Apps, and I worked as FullStack Developer.

After a year and a half, I started working as a cross-platform engineer, building apps for platforms like mobile, tv, android tv, iOS TV, firestick, Roku, SamsungTV -Tizen, and LG TV. I grow to Senior/Lead Software Engineer in less than three years

I also share my system with close friends who all had fantastic success

What is the secret? What does this mean, six cycles in six months?

Before explaining the system, I developed a few prerequisites, and you need to build a wall if you are willing to do it.

### Prerequisites

- Focus only on one thing/goal - in this case, only on Learning
- Develop Consistency & Discipline ( No Days Off )
- Be Persistent

### Focus only on one thing/goal - in this case, only on Learning"

- If you want to learn something, you need to be focused only on Learning. Don't do a diet challenge, stop smoking challenge or any other; your all focus is on learning the topic
- Self-control is regulating and controlling one's behavior, emotions, and thoughts. It is essential for achieving personal goals, making responsible decisions, and maintaining positive relationships with others. However, like any other cognitive ability, self-control has limits and can become exhausted over time

- The limits of self-control are due to several factors. First, self-control is a mental process that requires effort and resources from the brain, such as glucose and oxygen. When we exert self-control, we deplete these resources, making it harder to maintain self-control over time

- Second, our environment and daily stresses can also affect our self-control. Stressful situations, for example, can deplete our self-control reserves more quickly, leaving us with less ability to control our impulses or emotions

- Finally, our personality traits, such as our level of self-discipline, can affect our self-control. Some people naturally have more self-discipline than others, making it easier to control their behavior and emotions

- In summary, self-control has limits because it is a mental process that requires effort and resources and can affect our environment and personality traits. However, with practice and training, it is possible to improve our self-control and increase our ability to regulate our behavior and emotions over time

### Consistent and Discipline

- Set a goal of 180 days to learn something, and be focused only on that
- You must 'learn' every day for at least 2.5h up to 4/6 hours. You can do one hour of "learning" on some days ( rest days ), but those days must be sporadic ( You can have max five up to 7 intermittent days during 180 days challenge )

### Persistent

- Frustration is good when you are learning. It signals a challenge: Frustration can indicate that we have encountered a complex problem that we need to solve. That can help us focus our attention and effort on the task

- It promotes problem-solving skills: When we encounter frustration, we are often forced to think creatively and look for new solutions to problems. That can help us develop our problem-solving skills and adapt to challenges

- When you develop all those habits, it is time for a learning "Cycle System MLPS."

- Let's dive deep into the three main methods

- What does this mean, by Micro-Learning?

- Micro-learning is a form of Learning that focuses on delivering small, bite-sized pieces of content to learners in an easily digestible way and can be consumed quickly. This approach to Learning is often used to provide just-in-time training tailored to an individual's specific learning needs or to reinforce previous Learning

### The benefits of micro-learning include

- **Flexibility**: Micro-learning can be delivered in small, bite-sized chunks, making it easy for learners to fit learning into their busy schedules.

- **Engagement:** Because micro-learning is focused on delivering certain, relevant content, learners are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn.

- **Retention:** Micro-learning can improve information retention and learning effectiveness by delivering content in small, easily digestible chunks.
- **Personalization:** Micro-learning can be tailored to an individual's specific learning needs and interests, making it a highly personalized form of Learning.

- **Micro-learning** effectively provides targeted and personalized learning experiences that can improve training effectiveness and learning outcomes

- **Now you understand** what microlearning is, let's apply it. You choose any resource - book, video tutorial, coding websites and start learning

### What is Practical Learning?

- **Practical Learning** is an approach to education that emphasizes hands-on, real-world experience and application of knowledge. It involves learning through doing rather than just reading or listening to lectures. Practical Learning can take many forms, including internships, apprenticeships, simulations, lab work, and project-based Learning

### The benefits of practical Learning include the following

- **Improved retention:** Practical Learning allows learners to apply their knowledge in real-world settings, which can improve retention and understanding of concepts.
- **Skill development:** Practical Learning can help learners develop new skills and competencies that are highly valued in the workforce, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.
- **Real-world experience:** Practical Learning provides learners with real-world experience, which can help them understand how their knowledge and skills can be applied practically.
- **Career readiness:** Practical Learning can help learners prepare for their future careers by providing them with relevant, hands-on experience and exposure to industry-standard tools and technologies.

### Spaced Repetition

- **Spaced repetition** learning is an approach to learning that involves reviewing and rehearsing material at intervals over time to improve long-term retention. This method is based on the idea that we remember information more effectively when presented repeatedly over time rather than in one large chunk

- **Spaced repetition** learning involves breaking down information into small, manageable pieces and then reviewing and rehearsing that information at intervals that are optimized for long-term retention. The intervals are designed to be progressively longer as the learner becomes more familiar with the material, allowing optimal reinforcement without causing overload or burnout

- **Spaced repetition** learning can be applied to various learning contexts, including language learning, studying for exams, and professional development

```JavaScript
  const forntEndDeveloper = "Becoming a front-end developer involves learning various technical skills and building a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your abilities"

  console.log(frontEndDeveloper)
```
