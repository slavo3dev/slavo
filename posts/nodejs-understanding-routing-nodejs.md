Routing is a fundamental concept in web development. It determines how an application responds to client requests for specific endpoints, defined by a URL path and a particular HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). In Node.js, routing is crucial to building web applications and APIs. This section will cover routing requests in detail using the Express framework, a popular and powerful tool for managing routes in Node.js applications.

### Introduction to Express

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, creating routes, and managing middleware.

### Setting Up Express

To get started with Express, you need to install it using NPM. First, create a new Node.js project and install Express:

```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
npm init -y
npm install express
```

After installing Express, you can create a primary server and define routes.

### Basic Routing

Here's how to set up a simple Express server with basic routing:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("About Us");
});

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Form Submitted!");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, we define three routes:

- `GET /`: Responds with "Hello, World!" when a GET request is made to the root URL.
- `GET /about`: Responds with "About Us" when a GET request is made to the `/about` URL.
- `POST /submit`: Responds with "Form Submitted!" when a POST request is made to the `/submit` URL.

### Route Parameters

Route parameters are dynamic URL segments that can capture values from the URL and make them accessible in the request object. They are defined using a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name.

Here's an example:

```javascript
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

In this example, `:id` is a route parameter. When a request is made to `/user/123`, the `id` parameter will capture `123`, and the response will be "User ID: 123".

### Query Parameters

Query parameters are another way to pass data to the server. They are specified in the URL after a question mark (`?`) and are typically used to filter or sort data.

Here's an example:

```javascript
app.get("/search", (req, res) => {
  const { query, page } = req.query;
  res.send(`Search Query: ${query}, Page: ${page}`);
});
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/search?query=nodejs&page=2`, the `query` and `page` parameters are accessible via `req.query`.

### Handling Different HTTP Methods

Express allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Each technique serves a specific purpose in RESTful APIs:

- `GET`: Retrieve data from the server.
- `POST`: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- `PUT`: Update an existing resource on the server.
- `DELETE`: Delete a resource from the server.

Here's an example of handling different HTTP methods:

```javascript
app
  .route("/resource")
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send("Retrieve Resource");
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send("Create Resource");
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send("Update Resource");
  })
  .delete((req, res) => {
    res.send("Delete Resource");
  });
```

In this example, the `/resource` route handles GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

## Middleware for Routing in Node.js

Middleware is a fundamental concept in Express.js (and many other web frameworks) that allows you to execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack. Middleware functions are executed sequentially and perform various tasks, such as logging, authentication, error handling, etc. This section will explore using middleware effectively for routing in Node.js applications.

### What is Middleware?

Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware can perform any of the following tasks:

1. Execute any code.
2. Make changes to the request and response objects.
3. End the request-response cycle.
4. Call the following middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the following middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

### Using Middleware

To use middleware in an Express application, you use the `app.use()` method. Middleware can be applied globally (to all routes) or to specific routes.

#### Applying Middleware Globally

Global middleware functions are executed for every incoming request to the application. Here's an example of a global middleware function that logs the request method and URL:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("About Us");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, the `logger` middleware logs the HTTP method and URL for each incoming request. Since it is applied using `app.use()`, it runs for every request to the server.

#### Applying Middleware to Specific Routes

You can also apply middleware to specific routes or route groups. Here's an example:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers["authorization"] === "secret-token") {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
  }
};

app.get("/public", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Public Resource");
});

app.get("/private", authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Private Resource");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, the `authMiddleware` checks for an `authorization` header. If the header is present and correct, it calls `next()`, allowing the request to proceed. If not, it responds with a 403 Forbidden status. The middleware is applied only to the `/private` route.

### Built-in Middleware

Express comes with several built-in middleware functions that you can use to handle everyday tasks. Some of the most commonly used built-in middleware include:

- `express.json()`: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
- `express.urlencoded()`: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
- `express.static()`: Serves static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Here's an example of using built-in middleware:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  const { name, email } = req.body;
  res.send(`Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}`);
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example:

- `express.json()` is used to parse JSON payloads.
- `express.urlencoded()` is used to parse URL-encoded payloads.
- `express.static('public')` serves static files from the `public` directory.

### Third-Party Middleware

In addition to built-in middleware, you can use third-party middleware from the npm ecosystem. One popular third-party middleware is `morgan`, a logging middleware.

First, install `morgan`:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

Then, use it in your application:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");
const app = express();

app.use(morgan("dev"));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, `morgan` logs all incoming requests to the console in the 'dev' format, which provides concise output colored by response status for development use.

### Custom Middleware

Creating custom middleware allows you to encapsulate and reuse functionality across your application. Here’s how to create and use custom middleware:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const requestTime = (req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};

app.use(requestTime);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello, World! Request received at: ${req.requestTime}`);
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, the `requestTime` middleware adds a `requestTime` property to the request object, which records the time the request was received. This information is then accessible in the route handler.

### Error Handling Middleware

Error-handling middleware is a particular type of middleware that takes four arguments: `err,` `req,` `res,` and `next.` It is used to catch and handle errors that occur during the application's execution.

Here’s an example:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, an error is thrown in the route handler for the root URL. The error handling middleware catches the error, logs it, and responds with a 500 status code and an error message.

Middleware is a powerful and flexible feature in Express that allows you to add functionality to your application at various points in the request-response cycle. You can handle tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and more by using built-in, third-party, and custom middleware. Understanding how to use middleware for routing effectively will enable you to build robust, modular, and maintainable Node.js applications.

## Nested Routes in Node.js

In complex web applications, organizing routes logically and efficiently is often necessary. Nested routes allow you to group related routes together, improving code readability and maintainability. In Express, you can achieve nested routing using `express.Router()`, which provides a way to create modular, mountable route handlers.

### Introduction to Nested Routes

Nested routes help manage routes by breaking down a large set of routes into smaller, more manageable pieces. This organization is instrumental when dealing with resources that have related sub-resources. For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have products with associated reviews, categories, and ratings, each requiring its routes.

### Setting Up Nested Routes

To set up nested routes, you must create separate routers for different parts of your application and then mount these routers at specific paths. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create the Main Application File**

Start by creating the main application file (e.g., `app.js`), where you'll set up the Express application and use the routers.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Import routers
const productRouter = require("./routes/productRoutes");
const userRouter = require("./routes/userRoutes");

// Use routers
app.use("/products", productRouter);
app.use("/users", userRouter);

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

2. **Create a Router for Products**

Next, create a router for handling product-related routes in a separate file (e.g., `routes/productRoutes.js`).

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Routes for /products
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("List of Products");
});

router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Create a New Product");
});

// Nested routes for /products/:productId
router.get("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Details of Product ${productId}`);
});

router.put("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Update Product ${productId}`);
});

router.delete("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Delete Product ${productId}`);
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

3. **Create a Router for Users**

Similarly, create a router for handling user-related routes in another file (e.g., `routes/userRoutes.js`).

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Routes for /users
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("List of Users");
});

router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Create a New User");
});

// Nested routes for /users/:userId
router.get("/:userId", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  res.send(`Details of User ${userId}`);
});

router.put("/:userId", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  res.send(`Update User ${userId}`);
});

router.delete("/:userId", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  res.send(`Delete User ${userId}`);
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

### More Complex Nested Routes

Sometimes, you may need to nest routes even further. For example, suppose each product has associated reviews. You can create a nested router for reviews within the product router.

1. **Create a Router for Reviews**

Create a router for handling review-related routes (e.g., `routes/reviewRoutes.js`).

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router({ mergeParams: true });

// Routes for /products/:productId/reviews
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`List of Reviews for Product ${productId}`);
});

router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Create a New Review for Product ${productId}`);
});

router.get("/:reviewId", (req, res) => {
  const { productId, reviewId } = req.params;
  res.send(`Details of Review ${reviewId} for Product ${productId}`);
});

router.put("/:reviewId", (req, res) => {
  const { productId, reviewId } = req.params;
  res.send(`Update Review ${reviewId} for Product ${productId}`);
});

router.delete("/:reviewId", (req, res) => {
  const { productId, reviewId } = req.params;
  res.send(`Delete Review ${reviewId} for Product ${productId}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```

2. **Mount the Review Router in the Product Router**

In the `productRoutes.js` file, import and use the review router.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const reviewRouter = require("./reviewRoutes");

// Routes for /products
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("List of Products");
});

router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Create a New Product");
});

// Nested routes for /products/:productId
router.get("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Details of Product ${productId}`);
});

router.put("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Update Product ${productId}`);
});

router.delete("/:productId", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Delete Product ${productId}`);
});

// Use the review router for nested routes under /products/:productId/reviews
router.use("/:productId/reviews", reviewRouter);

module.exports = router;
```

### Benefits of Nested Routes

1. **Modularity**: Nested routes allow you to break down your application into smaller, reusable modules, making your codebase more organized and maintainable.

2. **Clarity**: Grouping related routes together makes it easier to understand the structure of your application and follow the flow of requests.

3. **Scalability**: As your application grows, nested routes provide a scalable way to manage increasing endpoints without cluttering your main application file.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: By separating different parts of your application into distinct routers, you can better adhere to the principle of separation of concerns, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

Nested routes in Node.js using Express provide a powerful way to organize your application's routes, making your codebase more modular, maintainable, and scalable. By creating separate routers for different parts of your application and nesting them logically, you can easily manage complex routing structures. Understanding and effectively using nested routes will help you build robust and well-structured web applications.

Routing is critical to web development, enabling you to handle different client requests and respond accordingly. With Express, routing becomes straightforward and flexible, allowing you to define routes for various HTTP methods, use route and query parameters, organize routes with middleware, and structure your application with nested routes. Mastering routing in Node.js with Express will equip you with the skills to build robust and scalable web applications.
